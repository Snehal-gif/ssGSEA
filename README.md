Single Sample Geneset Enrichment Analysis The ssGSEA method is an extension of the GSEA method, 
working at the level of a single sample rather than a sample population as in the original GSEA application. 
The score derived from ssGSEA reflects the degree to which the input gene signature is coordinately up- or downregulated within a sample.


Interpretation : A heatmap displaying the scaled ssGSEA scores for all the present gene sets .
Higher scores trend towards pink ,orange and purple colour .
Lower scores trend towards green and grey.
